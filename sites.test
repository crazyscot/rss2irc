# SYNTAX:
#   channel;feedshortname;colour;url
#   NB that channel must have no leading '#' or it will be mistaken
#   for a comment!
#   
#   NB. Every feed must have a different shortname or the cacheing
#   will get screwed up.

# FIXME:  TODO: Reinstate the proper URL-encoding in the bot.

# OTOH the Met Office site, at least the warnings, have serial numbers...
